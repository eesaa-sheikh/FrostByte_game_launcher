# FrostByte Game Launcher

## Project Description

A game launcher is an integral part of the gaming experience, serving as a bridge between the user and the games they know and love. This launcher will hold different user accounts and their respective collections of games, as well as a game library filled with all the games out there in the world. 

<!-- The launcher is the first piece of software a gamer will view, allowing them to buy games from a marketplace and organise them within their account.  -->

## MVP
We want to ensure the launcher is able to do the following:
- Create an account for a new user
- Show user profile details for an existing account
- Update user information for an existing account
- Delete an existing user account 
- Add a game from the Game library to the user's account *
- Show the games existing in the game library
- Connect the accounts to the games they own

## Extensions
- Have a wallet that allows user to buy a game and add the game to their account
- Allow user to filter game library using specific parameters
